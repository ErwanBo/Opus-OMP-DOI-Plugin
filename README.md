# Public Identifier DOI Plugin

## Information
The DOI (Digital Object Identifier) plugin provides an infrastructure for assigning unique DOI identifiers to articles, journal issues, and files. A DOI is a numeric identifier that allows for pointing to an electronic item (like an article) permanently, even if its URL changes. This facilitates the tracking, referencing, and citation of content items over time, irrespective of their location on the web.

Developer: Original plugin developed by the PKP team. The modification for obfuscation was carried out by the University Paris Cité Open Access team.

## Features 
* Automatic or manual DOI assignment.
* Integration with DOI registration agencies such as Crossref.
* Support for setting up DOI prefixes and suffixes.
* Customization option for an obfuscated form of DOIs, added by the University Paris Cité Open Access.

## How to use
1. Download the tar.gz release.
2. Upgrade the DOI plugin with the tar.gz through the "Website/Plugin/Installed Plugins" menu.

## Licensing
The DOI plugin is licensed under GPLv3.
